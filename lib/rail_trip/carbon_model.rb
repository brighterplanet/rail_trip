## Rail trip carbon model
# This model is used by [Brighter Planet](http://brighterplanet.com)'s carbon emission [web service](http://carbon.brighterplanet.com) to estimate the **greenhouse gas emissions of passenger rail travel**.
#
##### Calculations
# The final estimate is the result of the **calculations** detailed below. These calculations are performed in reverse order, starting with the last calculation listed and finishing with the emission calculation. Each calculation is named according to the `value` it returns.
#
##### Timeframe and date
# The model estimates the emissions that occur during a particular `timeframe`. To do this it needs to know the trip's `date`. For example, if the `timeframe` is January 2010, a trip that occurred on January 11, 2010 will have emissions but a trip that occurred on Febraury 1, 2010 will not.
#
##### Methods
# To accomodate varying client input, each calculation may have one or more **methods**. These are listed under each calculation in order from most to least preferred. Each method is named according to the `values` it requires ('default' methods do not require any values). Methods are ignored if any of the values they require are unvailable. Calculations are ignored if all of their methods are unavailable.
#
##### Standard compliance
# Each method lists any established calculation standards with which it **complies**. When compliance with a standard is requested, all methods that do not comply with that standard are ignored. This means that any values a particular method requires will have been calculated using a compliant method or will be unavailable.
#
##### Collaboration
# Contributions to this carbon model are actively encouraged and warmly welcomed. This library includes a comprehensive test suite to ensure that your changes do not cause regressions. All changes should include test coverage for new functionality. Please see [sniff](http://github.com/brighterplanet/sniff#readme), our emitter testing framework, for more information.
